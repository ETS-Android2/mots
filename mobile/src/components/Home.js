            the backbone of the healthcare system, and the focus and objective
            of the Mobile Training and Support (MOTS) project will be strengthening
            this network to ensure preparedness for Ebola vaccine campaigns and

            The project is setting up a MOTS service that is
            the vehicle for delivery of this training. This service will provide
            mobile training to CHWs via their mobile phones with feature phone as the
            basic requirement. The MOTS service will provide training modules that
            include units and quizzes, and allow monitoring by management.
