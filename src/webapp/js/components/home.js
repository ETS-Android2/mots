      <h4> As in many African countries, the Community Health Worker (CHW) is
        the backbone of the healthcare system, and the focus and objective
        of the Mobile Training and Support (MOTS) project will be strengthening
        this network to ensure preparedness for Ebola vaccine campaigns and
        outbreak response. <br /> <br />
        The project is setting up a MOTS service that is
        the vehicle for delivery of this training. This service will provide
        mobile training to CHWs via their mobile phones with feature phone as the
        basic requirement. The MOTS service will provide training modules that
        include units and quizzes, and allow monitoring by management.
